# Lessons learned
I need to reread (again) the lessons we had on objects I had a heard time
understanding the concept of objects and calling them in the class with
the main method. I also confused myself when i was making my loops for the
menu. I should have been able to just make it and have it print what I wanted
easily, but I did get confused.
